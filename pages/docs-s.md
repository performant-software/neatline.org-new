# Status of Neatline Support
Neatline is currently in the process of moving to a new home with Performant Software! More info will be forthcoming from Performant; you can direct any questions in the mean time to [Performant’s contact page](https://www.performantsoftware.com/contact.html).

# Neatline for Omeka S: Development Release 0.x

We’re happy to share a development release of Neatline for Omeka S. The version for this release is 0.1.0, so it’s not yet ready for production use. We’ll continue to work on the plugin, and do incremental 0.x releases until we’re ready to offer a stable, production-ready 1.0.

If you’re interested and willing to test out some beta software, check out our most recent release:

- [Neatline for Omeka S Development Release 0.x](https://github.com/scholarslab/neatline-omeka-s/releases)

Alternatively, if you like Docker, you can clone this Docker example, follow the README, and have a fresh Omeka S instance with the Neatline plugin referenced.

- [Omeka S + Neatline 3 Docker](https://github.com/scholarslab/neatline-omeka-s-docker)

The note on the 0.1.0 release lists some known issues. Additionally, we still have plenty of issues on Github to address. If you find an issue that is not already listed, we’d be grateful if you let us know about it by submitting a new issue on Github.

Immeasurable thanks to [Performant Software](https://www.performantsoftware.com/) for partnering with us on Neatline development, and to the [Office of Digital Humanities at the NEH](https://www.neh.gov/divisions/odh) for our grant support. We’re grateful for such wonderful collaborators and supporters.
